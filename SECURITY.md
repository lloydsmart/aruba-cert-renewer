# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is under active development.

Only the latest version of the `main` branch is actively maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature where available. If private reporting is unavailable, open an issue
requesting a private contact method without including details of the vulnerability.

Please include:

* A description of the issue.
* The affected component or file.
* Steps to reproduce or demonstrate the issue, where applicable.
* Any potential impact you have identified.
* Suggested mitigations, if known.

Do not include passwords, API credentials, private keys, or other live secrets in a report.

Security reports will be reviewed and addressed as appropriate.

## Security-Sensitive Areas

This project is intended to interact with network switches and certificate authority infrastructure. Security issues may
therefore include, but are not limited to:

* Exposure or unsafe handling of SSH or API credentials.
* Exposure or unsafe handling of private keys.
* Insufficient validation of certificate signing requests or signed certificates.
* Certificate validation bypasses.
* Command injection through configuration values or device data.
* Unintended or insufficiently constrained changes to network devices.
* Unsafe interaction with certificate authority APIs.

Particular care should be taken with any code capable of modifying device configuration or requesting, installing, or
renewing certificates.

## Sensitive Information

The repository must not contain passwords, access tokens, API keys, SSH private keys, certificate authority private keys,
or other authentication secrets.

Real deployment configuration, including device inventories and infrastructure details, should be kept outside the
repository where appropriate. The committed `config.example.toml` must contain only example data.

Public certificates and certificate signing requests are not normally secret, but their corresponding private keys must
never be committed or exported unnecessarily.

If sensitive information is committed accidentally, it should be treated as compromised and rotated or revoked as
appropriate, even if it is subsequently removed from the repository.
